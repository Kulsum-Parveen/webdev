<li><h4>DSA</h4> Data Structures  is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.</li>

<h3>Why to Learn DSA?</h3>
<p>Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.
DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc
Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA in interviews.
How to learn DSA?
Learn at-least one programming language (C++, Java, Python or JavaScript) and build your basic logic.
Learn about Time and Space complexities
Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
Practice DSA
Solve problems daily using GfG POTD, weekly using GfG Weekly Contest and monthly using GfG Job-A-Thon.</p>
<li> <h4>Logic Building</h4>
Once you have learned basics of a programming language, it is recommended that you learn basic logic building

Logic Building Problems
Practice Problems on Mathematical Algorithms</li>
<li><h4>Learn about Complexities</h4>
To analyze algorithms, we mainly measure order of growth of time or space taken in terms of input size. We do this in the worst case scenario in most of the cases. Please refer the below links for a clear understanding of these concepts.
