<li>SQL Uses
SQL's integration with various technologies makes it essential for managing and querying data in databases. Whether it's in traditional relational databases (RDBMS) or modern technologies such as machine learning, AI, and blockchain, SQL plays a key role. It works seamlessly with DBMS (Database Management Systems) to help users interact with data, whether stored in structured RDBMS or other types of databases.</li>

<li>Data Science & Analytics: Used for querying large datasets, data cleaning, and analysis. Analysts use SQL to generate reports and insights that inform business decisions.
Machine Learning & AI: Helps in preparing and managing the data required for training machine learning models and AI algorithms. It is used for data cleaning, transformation, and extraction.
Web Development: Used to manage user data, e-commerce transactions, and content management in websites and applications built with frameworks like Django, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
Cloud and Big Data: SQL is integrated into cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Microsoft)</li>
